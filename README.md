# PowerBI--Data-Analysis-Emerald-Bank
Developing and refining my skills in MySQL and Power BI by creating a project to analyze Emerald Bank customer data. The process involved generating a dataset in MySQL without using any external data, followed by data cleaning, optimization, and later using Power BI to visualize and gain deeper insights into customer data and business decisions.
