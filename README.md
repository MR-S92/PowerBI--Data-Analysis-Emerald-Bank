## PowerBI/SQL-Data Analysis Emerald Crown Bank
Developing and refining my skills in SQL and Power BI by creating a project to analyze Emerald Bank customer data. The process involved generating a dataset in MySQL without using any external data, followed by data cleaning, optimization, and later using Power BI to visualize and gain deeper insights into customer data and business decisions.

## Project Insight 

Customers in our New York branches carry the highest debt compared to those in other states. 

The Debt to Income (DTI) ratio indicates that individuals aged 31 and younger have a higher risk of loan repayment difficulties. A high DTI ratio is a potential concern, and a more in depth individual analysis is recommended. 

The customer distribution in 2025 is composed of 58% male and 42% female. 

The distribution of total debt and yearly Income by gender appears to be a general positive correlation total debt and yearly income for both genders. Individuals with higher incomes tend to have a higher debt. In addition, males take on larger debts relative to their income compared to females... Females tend to have lower debt levels and a more concentrated income range, indicating potentially more conservative financial behavior or different economic circumstances. 

Calculated a total sum of 1,174 customers in 2025. 

Total debt by state, with New York leading at 5.7M, followed by Florida 4M, and Texas 3.6M. 

## Final Conclusion: 

The Emerald Crown Bank’s client base in 2025 reflects a diverse and financially active demographic, with a slight majority of male clients 58% but a notable presence of female clients who tend to carry higher debts up to 1M and exhibit a wider income range. The average yearly income of 114.58K and recent growth in total income 5.4M in 2025 suggest a recovering or expanding client base with significant earning potential. However, the high DTI ratios among the 18–31 age groups indicate potential financial strain in these cohorts, which may warrant targeted risk management or financial advisory services. Geographically, the bank’s debt exposure is concentrated in high activity states like New York and California, reflecting a strategic focus on affluent or urban markets. Overall, the bank appears to be serving a moderately wealthy clientele with growing income trends, but it should monitor debt levels among younger middle aged clients to ensure long term financial stability.
