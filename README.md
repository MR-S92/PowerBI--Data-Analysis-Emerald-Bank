## Project Insight 

Customers in our New York branches carry the highest debt compared to those in other states. 

The Debt to Income (DTI) ratio indicates that individuals aged 31 and younger have a higher risk of loan repayment difficulties. A high DTI ratio is a potential concern, and a more in depth individual analysis is recommended. 

The customer distribution in 2025 is composed of 58% male and 42% female. 

The distribution of total debt and yearly Income by gender appears to be a general positive correlation total debt and yearly income for both genders. Individuals with higher incomes tend to have a higher debt. In addition, males take on larger debts relative to their income compared to females... Females tend to have lower debt levels and a more concentrated income range, indicating potentially more conservative financial behavior or different economic circumstances. 

Calculated a total sum of 1,999 customers in 2025. 

Total debt by state, with New York leading at 5.7M, followed by Florida 4M, and Texas 3.6M. 

## Final Conclusion: 

The financial analysis of Emerald Crown Bank Clients 2025 reveals a strong and financially active customer base, with an average yearly income of $112K and an average customer balance of $11K. The demographic composition is diverse, with a slight male majority 58% who tend to carry higher debt levels to $1M and exhibit a wider income range, while female clients also hold a notable presence. Debt distribution varies significantly across gender, age groups, and geographic locations. The 30-49 age group has the second to highest debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, while older customers appear more financially stable. Additionally, with the highest DTI ratios among the 18-31 age group indicate potential financial strain, which may require targeted risk management strategies. Geographically, debt is concentrated in major economic hubs like New York and Florida, likely due to higher living costs and greater borrowing needs. This pattern reflects a strategic focus on higher earners in the market and a strong potential for attracting new clients. Overall, the bank serves a moderately wealthy clientele with growing income trends, but it should closely monitor debt levels among younger and middle-aged clients to ensure long-term financial stability.
